##  Results

* Achieved **90.87% accuracy** in classifying benign vs malignant cases.
* Outperforms many traditional ML methods while maintaining **low FLOPs (192.19 MFLOPs)** and just **2.5M parameters** â€” making it highly efficient.
* Comparison with other architectures:

| Model           | Params | FLOPs | Accuracy   |
| --------------- | ------ | ----- | ---------- |
| **MobileNetV4** | 2.5M   | 192M  | **90.87%** |
| ResNet50        | 25.6M  | 4.1B  | 94.8%      |
| DenseNet-161    | 28.7M  | 7.8B  | 91.57%     |
| EfficientNet-B0 | 5.3M   | 390M  | 93.0%      |

 While ResNet/EfficientNet achieve slightly higher accuracy, **MobileNetV4 is far more computationally efficient**, making it ideal for **real-world deployment on mobile/edge devices**.
